## TEST the usage of slash and backslash in windows version ninja
## Result:
##   In windows OS, Ninja treats files with both forward slashes (/) and 
##   backslashes (\\) in their paths as referring to the same file.
##   But the command may not. ('echo' will but 'copy' not)
##
##   Ninja retains the file path as-is and does not automatically convert 
##   it to the systemâ€™s preferred separator
##

rule cp
    command = cmd /c copy $in $out

rule echo
    command = cmd /c echo hello > $out


# wrong!
# because 'copy' cannot locate the file with forward-slash '/'
#
# build proof/winninja/b.txt: cp proof/winninja/a.txt

# right!
build proof\winninja\b.txt: cp proof\winninja\a.txt

# right!
# echo can read the path with forward-slash '/'
#
build proof/winninja/c.txt: echo
